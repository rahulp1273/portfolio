<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m <strong>Rahul Panwar</strong>, a software developer currently based in <strong>Niigata, Japan</strong>. I specialize in building
modern web applications using <strong>Laravel</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>, with a focus on clean code, scalability, and a great user experience.</p>

<p>I’m passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. Recently, I’ve been exploring
cloud infrastructure with <strong>AWS</strong> and preparing for the <strong>Java SE 11 (Oracle Certified)</strong> exam to strengthen my backend
development knowledge. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and creating systems that make people’s work easier and more efficient.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring Japanese culture, learning new languages, or studying system design
documents to deepen my understanding of software architecture. I believe in lifelong learning and always strive to
improve both personally and professionally.</p>
